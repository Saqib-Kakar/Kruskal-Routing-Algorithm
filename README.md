  Kruskal-Routing-Algorithm
Java project visualizing Kruskal's MST using GraphStream

 Kruskal's Algorithm Routing Visualizer (Java 24.0.1 + GraphStream)
This project demonstrates the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's Algorithm, implemented in Java 24.0.1 and visualized with the GraphStream library.
It is part of the Computer Networks course project (CS-305), focused on simulating routing algorithms through graph-based visualization.


  **Tools and Technologies**

Java Version: 24.0.1  
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition  
Visualization Library: GraphStream (gs-core-1.3.jar)


   **Features**

- Visualizes Kruskal’s algorithm step-by-step
- Green-colored MST edges, gray unused edges
- Circular nodes with red fill and white bold labels
- Bold edge weights for clear visibility
- Clean layout and animated edge drawing
- Background color removed for better visibility
